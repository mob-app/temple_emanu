	<p>Established in 1934, our Men’s Club provides a welcoming community, enriching programs and wonderful support to the synagogue. Examples of annual programming at the Temple include a Yom Hashoah candle lighting program, dedicated volunteers who build the congregational Sukkah, Men’s Club Shabbat, engaging speaker presentations and much more. The Men’s Club also provides funds and volunteers for important synagogue family events. The Men’s Club commitment extends beyond the walls of the Temple as well. Some offsite fundraising events include The Ride2Provide – a spinathon to raise money for local food banks, a Golf/Tennis outing and participation in the JFS Meals for Wheels cycling event. To get involved, please email Men’s Club President, Adam Mimeles at amimeles@platzerlaw.com</p>
